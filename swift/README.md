# Swift

This build step invokes `swift` commands in [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/).

Arguments passed to this builder will be passed to `swift` directly,
allowing callers to run [any swift command](https://swift.org/lldb/).

## Examples

See examples in the `examples` subdirectory.
