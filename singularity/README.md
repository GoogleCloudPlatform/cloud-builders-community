# Singularity and Google Cloud Build

Hi friend! These examples will help to you create Singularity containers with 
[Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/) and push
them to Google Storage. There are two steps involved, with recipes
and instructions provided in the subfolders here:

 1. [Create a Builder](create-builder): will define a build step to create a cloud builder that we will use to build one or more containers.
 2. [Build a Container](run-builder): running the builder created in the first step will allow you to build a container, and upload to your cloud storage of choice.

Navigate to the subfolders to walk through each step.
