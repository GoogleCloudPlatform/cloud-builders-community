# InSpec

This build step invokes `inspec` commands in [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build).

Arguments passed to this builder will be passed to `inspec` directly, allowing
callers to run [any InSpec command](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/).

See examples in the `examples` subdirectory.
