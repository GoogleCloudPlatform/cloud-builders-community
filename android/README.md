# Android Builder
The Dockerfile and scripts here help you use Google Cloud Builder to build Android applications.  
These instructions assume that you have [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) installed and can build the subject Android application locally on your workstation.  
Steps to use:

##### 1. Create a list of the android sdk packages you need for you builds and save it to the builder directory as 'packages.txt'.  To generate the list from your workstation a script is provided: 

  ```
  $ ./installed-package-list.sh
  ```
**Note that this script will add every package from the workstation it's run on to the packages.txt file.** As a result, it will probably include things you don't need for your build container.  **Including components you don't need will increase both builder and application build times.**  Therefore, it is recommended that after you generate the packages.txt file you edit it to include only those sdk components that you need. Alternatively you can create this file manually, for example: 

  packages.txt |  
  :-----------|
  extras;m2repository;com;android;support;constraint;constraint-layout;1.0.2   <br/> extras;google;google_play_services <br/> extras;android;gapid;3 <br/>extras;google;auto <br/> extras;android;m2repository <br/>extras;google;webdriver <br/> platform-tools <br/> platforms;android-26 <br/>|


##### 2. Save your android sdk license to a shell variable. 
  ```
  $ ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE=$(tail -1 [ANDROID_SDK_HOME]/licenses/android-sdk-license)
  ```
 
  *Replace `[ANDROID_SDK_HOME]` with the location of your android sdk.*  
 *Usually:* 
  
  OS | Location 
  :---:|:---------:| 
  Mac | ~/Library/android/sdk |
  Unix | ~/Android/Sdk |


##### 3. Submit the build to Google Cloud Build.

  ```
  $ gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml . --substitutions=_ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE=$ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE
  ```

##### 4. Copy the example build configuration to the root directory of your android project. 
  
  ```
  $ cp android-build-example/simple-cloudbuild.yaml [ANDROID_PROJECT_DIR]

  ```
##### 5. Create a google cloud storage bucket to cache gradle dependencies. Replace `[ANDROID_BUILD_CACHE]` with the name of the bucket where you want to store the gradle dependencies.

  ```
  $ gsutil mb gs://[ANDROID_BUILD_CACHE]
  ```
##### 6. Create a google cloud storage bucket to deploy your android builds to: 
 
  ```
  $ gsutil mb gs://[DEBUG_BUILD_BUCKET]
  ```

##### 7. Create the build trigger for your android application and repository following [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds), *adding the following three Substitution Variables*: 

Variable | Value 
---------------------:|:----------|
`_ANDROID_BUILD_CACHE`  | `[ANDROID_BUILD_CACHE]`
`_ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE`  | `$ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE`
`_DEBUG_BUILD_BUCKET`        | `[DEBUG_BUILD_BUCKET]`
   


# What's included with this builder
## Android Builder Image 
The Dockerfile contained in this repository builds a an Docker container that includes the android SDK and gradle.  Customize this file to change the Android SDK components included in the base image.  

## gradle-build
The gradle-build scripts wraps the gradle build call with bash that will extract a ".gradle" directory that contains cached depenencies and zip up the same directory after the build completes.  This enables the rest of the cloudbuild to cache the gradle dependencies in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. 

## android-build-example/simple-cloudbuild.yaml
This is an example build configuration that uses [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) to build an Android application debug APK and make it available via a [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) bucket.

## android-build-example/fabric-beta-dist-cloudbuild.yaml
This is an example build configuration that uses [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) to build and distribute an Android application to beta testers using Fabric's Crashlytics. 

## cloudbuild.yaml 
This file builds the android builder.

## ci-cloudbuild.yaml
This file supports testing this cloud builder by adding a step that creates the packages.txt file prior to the build.
