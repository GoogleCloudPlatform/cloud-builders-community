# CFT (Cloud Foundation Toolkit)

This build step invokes `cft` commands in [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build).

Arguments passed to this builder will be passed to `cft` directly, allowing
callers to run [any CFT
command](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/blob/cloud-foundation/community/cloud-foundation/docs/userguide.md#cli-usage).

See examples in the `examples` subdirectory.
