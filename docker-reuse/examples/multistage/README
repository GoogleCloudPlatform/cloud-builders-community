This is a multistage build example, which pushes its intermediate image to the
container registry. When used in this manner, the container registry acts as a
content-addressable storage for intermediate images where the address of each
image is a function of the sources that comprise that particular image. In a
way, this achieves an effect similar to Docker layer caching, but on a global,
repository-wide scale.

This example demonstrates how this technique can be implemented by "chaining"
docker-reuse invocations.
